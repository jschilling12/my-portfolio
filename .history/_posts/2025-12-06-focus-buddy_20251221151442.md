# Project Update: Windows Process Querying 🖥️

I started this session with two main questions: **where will I store the data** and **how can I capture a window?** Once those variables were set, it became a matter of logic.

## Windows Process Query 🔍
Starting with a simple query on Windows process handling, it turns out processes are directly connected to **win32 wrappers**. This makes capture relatively easy; now it’s just about timing.

I utilized these resources to assist with process capture:
* [Track Windows App Usage (Dev.to)](https://dev.to/tkkhhaarree/track-windows-app-usage-time-using-python-h9h)
* [Obtain Active Window (Stack Overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10266281/obtain-active-window-using-python)

## Time Module and Loop ⏳
I moved on to learning about the `time` module to ensure a consistent loop. I'm using a **1-second timer** to capture start and end times. 

Initially, the documentation was a bit difficult to parse, but it clicked once I figured out how `time.sleep()` manages the loop frequency in conjunction with start and end timestamps.

## Logic for Process Monitoring 🧠
The logic follows a simple "snapshot" approach: 
1. Is the current process still matching the "new process" snapshot? 
2. **Yes:** No intervention needed (system checks every 1 second).
3. **No:** The timer calculates the duration of the old process, and the new process replaces it as the "current" one.

## Permissions and Access Denial 🛡️
I encountered some confusion around permissions and access denial. I found documentation and implemented `try/except` blocks to handle these edge cases. With the guidance of AI (set to study and learn mode), I refactored the code to avoid crashes due to permission errors.

## SQL Database and Future Plans 🗄️
I finished the session by building a skeleton for a **SQL database** to store the time-tracking data, utilizing some of my previous code. I'm planning to tackle the "Focus Buddy" features last, as the time-tracking algorithm was the more complex hurdle to clear first.
