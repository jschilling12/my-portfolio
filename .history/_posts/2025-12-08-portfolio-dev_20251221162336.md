# Devlog — 2025-12-08

I've solidified the vision for my digital presence: keeping a "to-the-point" main portfolio separate from a dedicated devlog "blog." While they will be connected, they serve distinct purposes.

## CI/CD and GitHub Actions
Coming back to the project, the primary hurdle was fixing the deployment pipeline. I initially struggled with the GitHub Action build failing. 

### The Fix: Ruby Versioning
After researching and consulting documentation:
* I initially looked into `Gemfile.lock` based on community suggestions regarding "bucket versions."
* I eventually identified that the **Ruby version** defined in the GitHub Actions `.yml` file was the culprit.
* Adjusting the version in the workflow file allowed the site to build successfully and reflect changes.

## Architecture Roadmap
My goal is to build a robust pipeline that connects my various platforms:
* **Primary Portfolio:** `jordanschilling.me` hosted on AWS, managed via Ansible and CI/CD.
* **Blogging ecosystem:** A dedicated API connecting the main site to the GitHub-hosted devlog at `jordanschilling.blog`.
