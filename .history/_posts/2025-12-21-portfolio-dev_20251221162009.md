# Devlog — 2025-12-21

Today I focused on the infrastructure of the site—ensuring that content flows dynamically from the `_posts` directory without breaking navigation.

## What I Accomplished
I explored the Jekyll documentation and used AI as a thought partner to understand the underlying backend of the platform:
* **Dynamic Rendering:** Learned how Jekyll automatically pulls content from the `_posts` folder.
* **Liquid Logic:** Implemented Liquid `for` loops to iterate over posts and render them automatically.
* **Path Resolution:** Diagnosed why links were routing to GitHub’s 404 page (missing base URL context).
* **Content Design:** Built out content for all the DevLogs recorded so far.

## The Key Fix 
The breakthrough was realizing that my paths weren't respecting the site's subfolder structure. I updated the `_config.yml` and forced the links to include the `baseurl`:

```html
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
```

Linked to a custom domain:

```yml
url: "https://jordanschilling.me"
baseurl: ""
```
