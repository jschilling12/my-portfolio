# Devlog — 2025-12-20

It was a late night working on the portfolio. I realized my original design wasn’t hooking in correctly because the repository I was using (from MIT) is currently under construction, making it impossible to continue with that specific Jekyll template.

## The Pivot to Minimal
I decided to fork the **Minimal** theme repository instead. This version offers more customization and gave me a chance to really learn how the underlying components are hooked together. After diving into the documentation and doing some manual exploration, I've found a good rhythm and flow with the new setup.

## Technical Considerations
* **Ansible:** While the current GitHub Pages setup might not strictly require Ansible, I'm still looking for a meaningful use case to keep it in the stack.
* **Hosting:** The site is currently hosted via **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions** for deployment.
* **Architectural Goals:** I am still interested in following my original UML design for the broader ecosystem.

## Project Roadmap & UML
The goal is to connect these pieces into a cohesive pipeline:

1.  **Main Portfolio:** `jordanschilling.me`
2.  **Deployment Pipe:** Ansible → CI/CD → AWS
3.  **Blogging Integration:** A Blogging Platform API connecting back to the GitHub portfolio at `jordanschilling.blog`.
