# About This DevLog

Welcome! This space is dedicated to tracking my technical growth and documenting the build process of my current projects. I use this devlog to separate my deep-dive technical "logs" from my primary professional portfolio.

## Project Milestones

A tool designed to help developers track their deep-work sessions directly from a custom GUI. 
* **Focus**: CLI logic, win32 process querying, and Python time-management modules.

### Medium Term: Net Worth Web App
A personal finance tool to visualize and track total asset growth over time.
* **Focus**: Web frameworks, SQL database management, and Docker containerization.

### Long Term: AI Calendar Manager
An intelligent task and habit manager that uses AI to optimize daily schedules.
